## Installation

- **Install ESP32 Board Package**:
  - Open Arduino IDE.
  - Go to `Tools > Board > Board Manager`.
  - Search for and install `esp32`.
- **Install Audio Tools Library**:
  - Go to `Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries`.
  - Add the [Arduino Audio Driver Library](https://github.com/pschatzmann/arduino-audio-driver/tree/main) by Peter Schatzmann.
  - you have to download the zip btw
- **Connect ESP32 to Computer**:
  - Use a USB cable to connect your ESP32 to the computer.
- **Select Board and Port**:
  - Go to `Tools > Board` and select your ESP32 board (e.g., "ESP32 Dev Module").
  - Go to `Tools > Port` and select the appropriate COM port (this might be automatic).
- **Write and Upload Sketch**:
  - Write your sketch in the Arduino IDE.
  - Click the upload button to transfer the sketch to the ESP32.
- **Open Serial Monitor**:
  - Go to `Tools > Serial Monitor`.
  - Set baud rate to `115200` (or the baud rate specified in your sketch).
  - The Serial Monitor will display messages from your ESP32, including IP addresses and debug information.



## Uploading files to serve (In flash memory)
The SPIFFS filesystem is initialized in the setup function, and its contents are printed to the serial monitor.
Files are added to SPIFFS storage using the ESP32 Sketch Data Upload tool in the Arduino IDE.
I used this tool to upload

https://github.com/me-no-dev/arduino-esp32fs-plugin/releases/

#To install
- Unpack the tool into the tools directory
   (the path will look something like `$HOME/Arduino/tools/ESP32FS/tool/esp32fs.jar`).
- Restart Arduino IDE.
